# AI Assistant Guidelines

When receiving a task to work on this repository, follow these steps:

## 1. 📚 Read Project Documentation

**Before starting any work**, read these files if you haven't already:
- `Docs/PROJECT_MAP.md` - Understanding the codebase structure
- `Docs/GUIDELINE.md` - Development conventions and best practices

## 2. 🔍 Research When Needed

If the user mentions a card or relic name without providing details:
- Search the web for the card/relic description
- Understand its mechanics and effects before implementing
- Verify the information matches the source game (Slay the Spire)

## 3. ✅ Plan and Confirm

**Unless the user explicitly allows you to proceed immediately:**
- Create a detailed implementation plan
- Present the plan to the user for approval
- Ask: "Do you need tests for this implementation?"
- Wait for confirmation before proceeding

## 4. 🧪 Testing Strategy

When testing is required:
- For testing a **single file or component**, use direct test commands
- For testing **multiple files or comprehensive test suites**, it's more suitable to run Python scripts
- Python scripts provide better control, logging, and can handle complex test scenarios efficiently

Following these steps ensures consistent, high-quality contributions to the project.
