CENTRALIZED PIPELINE ARCHITECTURE - IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
========================================================

This directory contains all core combat verbs and their pipelines.

PHILOSOPHY:
-----------
These functions are the CORE of the game. They WILL be modified directly and radically.

We are NOT following Open/Closed Principle.
We are NOT designing for abstract extensibility.
We are NOT trying to write code that doesn't need modification.

Instead:
- These pipelines are where ALL logic lives
- When we add a new mechanic, we OPEN this file and MODIFY the core function
- Hardcoded if-statements checking flags and IDs go HERE
- This is VISIBILITY and SIMPLICITY, not modularity

EXPECT:
-------
- DealDamage to grow from 10 lines to 50+ as we add interactions
- ApplyBlock to gain special cases as we add relics
- PlayCard to be radically modified as card mechanics evolve
- Status effects to be hardcoded directly into their handler functions

That's the entire point. One place to understand the full combat flow.

STRUCTURE:
----------
Each verb takes 'world' as first argument - the game state object that contains:
- Current player
- Current enemy
- Current combat log
- Effect queue
- Deck, hand, discard pile
- All relics, status effects, etc.

This is intentional. Verbs need full access to game state to avoid parameter hell.
